	<h1 class=page2>HALO 2</h1>
	<br/><br/><br/><p>Released in 2004 for the original Xbox, Halo 2 was the highly anticipated sequel to Halo: Combat Evolved, developed by Bungie.<br/>
	The game continued the story of Master Chief, a super-soldier fighting against the alien Covenant, while introducing players to the Arbiter, 
	an Elite warrior with his own perspective on the war.
<br/><br/>
Halo 2 revolutionized first-person shooters with its dual-wielding mechanic, improved AI, and cinematic storytelling.<br/> However, its biggest impact 
came from its online multiplayer, which was a defining moment for Xbox Live.<br/> The introduction of matchmaking and competitive ranked play set the 
foundation for modern online gaming.<br/><br/>

Despite its infamous cliffhanger ending, Halo 2 became one of the best-selling Xbox games of all time and solidified Halo as Microsoft's flagship
franchise. <br/>Its legacy lives on through Halo: The Master Chief Collection, where fans can experience its iconic campaign and multiplayer once again.
