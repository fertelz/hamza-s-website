	<h1 class=page2>FABLE</h1>
	<br/><br/><br/><p>Released in 2004 for the original Xbox, Fable was an ambitious action RPG developed by Lionhead 
	Studios and led by Peter Molyneux.<br/> The game was praised for its unique morality system, allowing players to shape their
	hero's story through choices that affected their appearance, reputation, and the world around them.<br/><br/>

Set in the fantasy land of Albion, Fable follows a young orphan who rises from humble beginnings to become a legendary hero or 
a feared villain.<br/> The game's real-time combat, quirky British humor, and engaging quests made it a standout title for the Xbox. <br/>Though
 some of its promised features didn't make it into the final game, Fable was a commercial and critical success.<br/><br/>

The game spawned several sequels, including Fable II (2008) and Fable III (2010),<br/> each expanding on the series' choice-driven gameplay.<br/>
 A new Fable reboot is currently in development, proving that the franchise remains one of Xbox's most beloved RPG series.<br/>
