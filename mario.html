		Super Mario made its debut in 1985 with the release of Super Mario Bros.<br/> for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). <br/> Created by legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, the game was a revolutionary
		step in the platformer genre. Players took control of Mario, a plumber on a quest to rescue Princess Toadstool	 (later known as Princess Peach) from the evil Bowser.<br/> The game introduced groundbreaking 
		mechanics, such as side-scrolling gameplay, power-ups like the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, and innovative level designs that kept players coming back for more.<br/>
Super Mario Bros. became an instant success, quickly becoming one of the best-selling video games of all time. Its success laid the foundation for countless sequels, spin-offs, and an entire franchise that 
includes Super Mario 64, Super Mario Odyssey,<br/> and numerous others, each pushing the boundaries of what platformers could achieve.<br/>Over the years, Mario's adventures have evolved from 2D side-scrolling to 3D 
open worlds, but the core appeal of Mario's charm, creativity, and fun gameplay <br/>has remained unchanged.
