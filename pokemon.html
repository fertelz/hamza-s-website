        <p>Pokemon debuted in 1996 with Pokemon Red and Green (later released as Red and Blue internationally) for the Game Boy.<br/> Created by Satoshi Tajiri 
		and developed by Game Freak,<br/> the game introduced players to a world where they could catch, train, and battle creatures known as Pokemon. <br/>The goal
		was to become the Pokemon Champion while completing the Pokedex.<br/><br/>

The game's success led to a multimedia empire, including trading cards, an anime series, and countless sequels.<br/> Pokemon Gold and Silver expanded the formula 
with new Pokemon and a real-time clock,<br/> while Pokemon X and Y brought the series into 3D.<br/> The franchise remains one of the most successful in gaming history, 
continuing to evolve with titles like Pokemon Sword and Shield and Poke	mon Legends: Arceus.
