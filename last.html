	<br/><br/><br/>
	<p>Released in 2020 for the PlayStation 4, The Last of Us Part II is the sequel to Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed The Last of Us (2013).<br/>
	Set five years after the first game, it follows Ellie as she navigates a brutal world shaped by loss, revenge, and the consequences of past actions.<br/>
	The game introduced players to a dual-perspective narrative, shifting between Ellie and a new character, Abby, offering a unique look at morality in a world without rules.<br/><br/>

With its stunning visuals, fluid combat mechanics, and advanced AI, Part II set a new benchmark for realism and immersion in gaming. <br/>The game's bold storytelling choices sparked 
both praise and controversy, but it went on to win multiple Game of the Year awards, cementing its place as one of the most ambitious and influential PlayStation exclusives.<br/>
