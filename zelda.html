	<h1 class=page2>The legend of Zelda</h1>
	<br/><br/><br/>
	<p>The Legend of Zelda was first released in 1986 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka.<br/>
	The game introduced players to the fantasy world of Hyrule, where Link embarks on a quest to rescue Princess Zelda and defeat the evil Ganon.<br/>
	With its open-ended exploration and puzzle-solving gameplay, Zelda set a new standard for adventure games.<br/><br/>

Over the years, the series evolved with classics like A Link to the Past, which refined the top-down formula, and Ocarina of Time, which revolutionized 
3D action-adventure games. <br/>More recently, Breath of the Wild redefined open-world gameplay, earning critical acclaim for its vast world and player freedom.<br/>

With each installment, The Legend of Zelda continues to push the boundaries of gaming, remaining one of Nintendo's most iconic and influential franchises.
