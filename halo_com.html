	<br/><br/><br/><p>
	Released in 2001 as a launch title for the original Xbox, Halo: Combat Evolved revolutionized first-person shooters
	and became the foundation of one of gaming's most iconic franchises.<br/> Developed by Bungie, the game introduced players 
	to Master Chief, a super-soldier known as a Spartan, who battles the alien Covenant on a mysterious ring-shaped world called Halo.<br/><br/>

With its gripping campaign, open-ended level design, and tight gunplay, Halo redefined console shooters.<br/> The introduction of regenerating shields, 
vehicular combat, and a rich sci-fi narrative set it apart from other FPS games of the time.<br/> Halo's local multiplayer also became a fan favorite, 
leading to legendary LAN parties before online gaming took off.<br/><br/>

Beyond its single-player experience, Halo: Combat Evolved laid the groundwork for the success of Halo 2 and the rise of Xbox as a dominant gaming 
platform. <br/>Its influence can still be felt in modern shooters, and its legacy remains strong through Halo: The Master Chief Collection.
