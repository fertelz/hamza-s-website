	<p>
	God of War, released in 2005 by Santa Monica Studio, was a groundbreaking action-adventure game that introduced players to Kratos, a Spartan warrior on a quest for vengeance against the Greek gods.<br/>
	The game's brutal combat, epic storytelling, and mythological setting quickly made it a standout title for the PlayStation 2, and it became one of the most iconic franchises in gaming history.<br/><br/>

In 2018, the series was reimagined with a new entry simply titled God of War.<br/> This time, Kratos is older, wiser, and living in the world of Norse mythology, trying to balance his violent past with 
his role as a father to his son, Atreus. <br/>The game introduced a more personal narrative, focusing on the father-son relationship and their journey to scatter the ashes of Kratos's wife.
<br/><br/>
The 2018 God of War was praised for its stunning visuals, seamless combat, and emotional depth, earning numerous Game of the Year awards. It revitalized the franchise with a new perspective on the 
character of Kratos, making it not only one of PlayStation's best games but also a hallmark of modern action-adventure storytelling.
